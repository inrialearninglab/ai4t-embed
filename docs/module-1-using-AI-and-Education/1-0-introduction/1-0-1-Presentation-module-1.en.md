# Presentation of Module 1
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making its way into our daily lives for a few years now, for example to manage spam in our emails or to present information tailored to our reading preferences on social networks.

In the professional domain, the list of jobs that will be most affected by AI in the years to come, we find not only jobs such as train driving or counter work, but also in banking and insurance, in accounting, in office automation or in management.

In the next few years, is the field of education also concerned by the development of these technologies?

- Are these AI technologies already available and what would be their uses for the benefit of the teachers, the teaching professional practices and the learners?
- What are the challenges associated with the use of these technologies in Education?
