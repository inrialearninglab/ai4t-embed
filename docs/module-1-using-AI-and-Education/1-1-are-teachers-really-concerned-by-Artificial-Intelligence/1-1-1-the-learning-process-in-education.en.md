# A Walk through AI - The Learning Process in Education
## Introduction

It is now common knowledge that many websites are able to recommend a film or a product based on what you have previously seen and liked. Some of these websites are also able to tell which films we can go and see with our family, and which ones with a group of friends.

The question we ask ourselves is: *Why not use the same strategies to personalise learning paths by providing the teacher with appropriate learning resources for a student or group of students?*

If we take another example, based on the captors present on our smartphones. Some applications allow us to record our movements, measure the number of steps we take every day, visualise and analyse the calories we have burned, the performance we have achieved during the last run, or the diet we should follow to reach our weight goals.

Another question we can ask is: *Wouldn't activity tracking also be useful in teaching, to better identify, understand and support the learner?*

Since such many captors and software tools can provide feedback, synthesis, predictions, recommendations, and visualisations of all the analyses carried out, to optimise activities in diverse fields. Why not take advantage of these technological frameworks of artificial intelligence to optimise the field of education?

In this context, we propose **"A walk through Artificial Intelligence", a series of 3 introductory videos** to dig deeper through these questions and explore the role of Artificial Intelligence, more specifically learning analytics, can play in education. Learning Analytics is commonly defined as the observation, analysis and visualisation of the learner's digital behaviours in their online learning activity.
