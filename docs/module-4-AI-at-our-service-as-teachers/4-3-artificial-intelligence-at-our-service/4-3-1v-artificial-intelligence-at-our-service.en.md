# Video: Artificial Intelligence at our Service?

This video aims to define what explicability is in the field of AI and its stakes. Namely, how an answer is constructed in a decision support tool. In view of the stakes of certain decisions, whether in the medical field or in student orientation for example, the video opens the debate on the question of the legal framework of AI and the necessary information for users to make informed choices.

The video also provides an overview on the notion of "explainability" in the form of a cartoon (from 3'45" to 4'30").

Designed with a humorous tone, the video can bee used in the classroom.

####Synopsis
The main character, _Guillaume_, reminds us of the challenges of AI in a very wide range of fields.Â He emphasises that this reflection on artificial intelligence also leads us to reflect on human intelligence. And this reflection leads to a questioning of humanity and our role as citizens in society.  
The discussion with _The Hotline_ then focuses on the notion of creativity and its unique link with human intelligence. And just as AI cannot create but only imitate, they cannot feel emotions but only imitate the manifestations of our emotions.  
It is then stated that AI are valuable decision support tools, in a wide variety of fields. However, these AI can have flaws, and it is important that we know what they contain (i.e. which algorithms and which data) which is not so easy.  
This observation leads _Guillaume_ and _The Hotline_ to end their discussions on the conditions of a trustworthy AI and its stakes in our lives as human beings and citizens.
